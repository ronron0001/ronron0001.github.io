    <h2><a href="20250617-e.html">My aspirations for the PhD program in Sendai</a> (2025.06.17)</h2>
    <p>In the spring of 2025, I began my PhD in Sendai. Having grown up in Fukuoka and spent both my undergraduate and master’s years in Tokyo, I found the season of enrollment in Sendai somewhat chilly. Two months had already passed quickly. Since my research training during my undergraduate and master’s studies had been primarily focused on experimental condensed matter physics, it took me some time to adjust to the rhythm of a new research life. Nevertheless, I feel that I am finally beginning to find my footing.</p>
    <p> In experimental research, my days used to follow a familiar pattern: studying papers and textbooks lightly in the morning, then spending the afternoon immersed in experiments while fighting off post-lunch drowsiness. In theoretical research, by contrast, one is constantly face to face with the desk. Mornings are highly productive, but as the afternoon wears on, fatigue slows the mind. Lately, I have taken to casually visiting the department library in the afternoons, browsing through a few appealing books and recharging my mental energy. After two months of such daily routines, I feel that my research interests and goals are finally becoming clear.</p>
    <p> Transitioning from experimental to theoretical research at the doctoral level is a rather unconventional challenge. I intend to immerse myself fully in theoretical physics over the next three years or so (optimistically speaking), without regret over this decision. Although I have no clear vision yet of my research themes after completing the PhD, my current goal is to contribute to building a bridge between experiment and theory, and more broadly between physics and mathematics.</p>
    <p>Finally, I would like to briefly explain the motivation behind starting this blog. When I was an undergraduate student, the lives of graduate students and researchers were shrouded in mystery. I read various researchers’ blogs in an attempt to grasp the atmosphere of different research fields, but at the time I could not find one that truly matched my own interests. Hoping that this blog might offer some guidance or reassurance to young students facing similar uncertainties, I decided to start writing. Another driving force behind this blog is my long-held ambition to realize a genuine integration of theory and experiment in condensed matter physics, and to foster more researchers who can operate fluently in both domains. With these dreams and aspirations in mind, my research life in a new land in northeastern Japan now begins.</p>
