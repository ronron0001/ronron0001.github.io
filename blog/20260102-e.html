    <p>2025 is a year filled with new challenges in a new environment and encounters with new colleagues. I spent much of it simply trying to adapt. As I transitioned from experimental condensed matter physics to condensed matter theory, I occasionally found myself puzzled by differences in research styles and approaches. Nevertheless, I am deeply grateful to N., a third-year doctoral student whose research interests were close to mine, for generously discussing research issues with me and providing invaluable support throughout the year. I am also sincerely thankful to my supervisor, Professor Koretsune, who kindly accepted my many requests and enabled me to participate in various meetings and intensive courses. Thanks to this support, the year turned out to be extremely fulfilling.</p>
    <p> Here, I would like to briefly look back on the events of the year. The first academic event was the Annual Meeting of the Physical Society of Japan, held in September at Hiroshima University. It was my very first poster presentation at a JPS meeting, so I was understandably nervous. A particularly memorable incident occurred on the morning of the poster session, when my poster — still inside its case — was stolen from the hotel (dormitory-style rooms). During the lunch break that day, I rushed to a convenience store, printed the poster in several A3 sheets, and somehow managed to assemble it with scissors and glue. This was an unforgettable experience. In October, I participated in the annual Imoni (taro stew) gathering at the condensed matter theory group of Tohoku University. I had heard from SSMT, a second-year doctoral student, that this event is “delta-function-like enjoyable” within the doctoral program, and I had been looking forward to it; it certainly lived up to my expectations — perhaps more like a Lorentzian. In December, I attended the Asymmetry Workshop held in Gotemba. It was highly informative, providing insights into the latest research trends on multipole physics. I was also very pleased that my poster presentation attracted strong interest from Professor J.H. from O Univ. and a professor NMR from T Univ.</p>
    <p> Although the year was highly productive and fulfilling, I have yet to publish any papers. In 2026, I aim to complete and submit solid academic papers and to determine a destination for my GPSPIN overseas research program—ideally, I hope to already be abroad. With the hope that the coming year will be a good one for everyone, I would like to conclude this essay.</p>
